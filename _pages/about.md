I have completed my Bachelor of Science degree from North South University, Dhaka Bangladesh. I have worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at North South University. My research interests are in the areas of Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Image Segmentation. I have implemented efficient methodologies and dataset for image-based virtual try-on and became 2nd Runner-up in NSU ACM SC Innovation Challenge 2022 at North South University. I am currently holding the position of Treasurer at North South University Athletics Club. 

I consistently achieved academic excellence in both my coursework and extracurricular activities as well as gained “Summa Cum Laude” the highest distinction. Due to my great academic record, I received the opportunity to study with a 100% tuition waiver.
