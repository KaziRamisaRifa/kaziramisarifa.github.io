I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have worked as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the Department of ECE at North South University. My research interests are in **Computer Vision**, **Generative Adversarial Networks**, and **Image Segmentation**. I have implemented efficient methodologies and datasets for image-based virtual try-on and became the 2nd Runner-up in NSU ACM SC Innovation Challenge 2022 at North South University. I am currently holding the position of **Treasurer** at North South University **Athletics Club**. 

I consistently achieved academic excellence in both my coursework and extracurricular activities as well as gained **“Summa Cum Laude”** the highest distinction. Due to my great academic record, I received the opportunity to study with a **100% tuition fee waiver**.
