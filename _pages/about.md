I'm a first-year Computer Science **PhD student** at the University of Kentucky, as advised by Professor [Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran](https://aaz-imran.github.io/). I have completed my bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Previously, I served as a **Teaching Assistant (TA)** in the Department of ECE at North South University. My research interests are in Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Medical Image Segmentation. I have implemented efficient methodologies and proposed datasets for image-based virtual try-on and became the 2nd Runner-up in NSU ACM SC Innovation Challenge 2022 at North South University.

I consistently achieved academic excellence in both my coursework and extracurricular activities, as well as gained **“Summa Cum Laude”** the highest distinction. Due to my great academic record, I received the opportunity to study with a **100% tuition fee waiver**.
