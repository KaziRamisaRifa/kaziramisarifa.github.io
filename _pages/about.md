I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science **PhD student** at the University of Kentucky, advised by [Dr. Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran](https://aaz-imran.github.io/), and working in the areas of computer vision and medical imaging. My current research focuses on CT image synthesis using diffusion models to enhance the quality and diversity of synthetic medical imaging data. Prior to this, I served as a **Teaching Assistant (TA)** in the Department of ECE, [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), and completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh where I was advised by [Dr. Nabeel Mohammed](https://ece.northsouth.edu/people/dr-nabeel-mohammed/). 

In my undergraduate thesis, I implemented efficient methodologies and proposed datasets for 2D image-based virtual try-on and became the 2nd Runner-up in NSU ACM SC Capstone Innovation Challenge 2022 at North South University. I consistently achieved academic excellence in both my coursework and extracurricular activities, as well as gained **“Summa Cum Laude”** the highest distinction. Due to my great academic record, I received the opportunity to study with a **100% tuition fee waiver**.
